This case study specifically focuses on the DVIR (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report) portion of the app. The DVIR is a report every truck driver must complete before and after their daily tasks to ensure safe operation of their vehicle. I collaborated very closely with the product owner and engineering team on this project.<br><br></p>

                                    All truck drivers are required to inspect their truck prior to driving (pre-trip inspection) and after driving (post-trip inspection) everyday. This is a regulation mandated by the Department of Transportation to ensure driver and roadside safety. A thorough truck inspection should take around 15 minutes to complete. Should a vehicle have any defects, it should be marked on the report and given to a mechanic to be fixed and signed off on.

                                    The previous design of the DVIR required the drivers to take photos of the front, back, and sides of the truck. The designers designed it this way in an attempt to force the driver to walk around their truck. But the problem with that was a lot of the the drivers were taking random pictures to skip through this tedious process.

                                    The company needed to address the problem of non-compliant drivers uploading random photos in place of proper photos of their truck. Our company had been randomly selected by the Department of Transportation to be audited for how closely we follow the safety and compliance requirements. This was when the business requirements really kicked our butts.

                                    After gathering the requirements and understanding the problem, Jackie and I broke down this information by sketching out different designs to fulfill the business and user needs.<br><br>

                                    We each ideated 2-3 screen ideas for each major requirement and came back together to share them with each other. During this process we identified <b>reusable UI elements</b> and consolidated them into symbols in Sketch. This helped cut down on time wasted when translating our design from low to high fidelity and from high fidelity to development.

                                    We picked the best ideas from each other’s sketches and combined them into a single design. One major requirement we ideated was the elements on the home screen. We made sure to keep all the important information on one screen so that it’s easily accessible to drivers.

                                    One major issue we discovered was that there were currently “too many pages to go through just to add a note”.  We realized that we had overlooked a major part of the paper log process: the ability to write a note about why they switched to a particular duty status. We had this feature, but it was a bit “hidden” because we didn’t realize how important and frequently used this feature would be.
