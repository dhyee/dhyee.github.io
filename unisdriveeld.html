                                <p class="desctxt">UNIS Drive is a mobile app aimed to help company truck drivers more easily complete their day-to-day tasks. This case study specifically focuses on the ELD (Electronic Logging Device) portion of the app. ELD helps solve the issue of drivers having to log their hours of service on paper by allowing them to accurately track and manage their hours in the app. I collaborated very closely with the product owner, engineering team, and fellow UI/UX Designer, Jackie Lee, from concept to launch.<br><br></p>

                                    Certain truck drivers that drive long distances must follow a strict driving schedule so that they are compliant with hours of service regulations set forth by the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration). The original method of logging these hours was by paper (seen below). However starting December 2017, all logs must be electronically reported through an Electronic Logging Device (ELD). In order to solve this need, our company decided to create their own ELD app.

                                    After gathering the requirements and understanding the problem, Jackie and I broke down this information by sketching out different designs to fulfill the business and user needs.<br><br>

                                    We each ideated 2-3 screen ideas for each major requirement and came back together to share them with each other. During this process we identified <b>reusable UI elements</b> and consolidated them into symbols in Sketch. This helped cut down on time wasted when translating our design from low to high fidelity and from high fidelity to development.

                                    We picked the best ideas from each other’s sketches and combined them into a single design. One major requirement we ideated was the elements on the home screen. We made sure to keep all the important information on one screen so that it’s easily accessible to drivers.

                                    One major issue we discovered was that there were currently “too many pages to go through just to add a note”.  We realized that we had overlooked a major part of the paper log process: the ability to write a note about why they switched to a particular duty status. We had this feature, but it was a bit “hidden” because we didn’t realize how important and frequently used this feature would be.
