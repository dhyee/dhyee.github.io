                            <p class="abouttxt">UC San Diego's on-campus coffee vendor Muir Woods Coffee House was in need of their own website to help promote themselves to both students and non-students. Their current mode of promotion was only by word of mouth and through an extension website from UCSD. So in a team of 3, we worked closely with our client, the Director of Muir Woods Coffee House, in order to create a website that met his needs.<br><br>

                                After working with a real client, it was interesting to see how different client needs are from the target user’s needs. Before this project, I didn’t realize that these needs could and would clash so I wasn’t exactly sure how to balance them once they did clash. It’s difficult to decide whether we should listen to the client because they’d be the one paying for our services or listen to the end users since they’ll be the ones using and determining the success of the product. But as we worked through the project, we all learned how to better prioritize these needs.
